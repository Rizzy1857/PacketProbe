# PacketProbe v1.0

A **simple yet powerful network sniffer** built with Python using **Scapy**. It captures real-time network packets and displays source/destination IPs along with the protocol used (TCP/UDP/ICMP). Ideal for beginners diving into network security and packet analysis.

---

##  Features

-  **Sniffs network traffic** in real-time
-  **Displays IP addresses** (source & destination)
-  **Detects protocols:** TCP, UDP, ICMP, and others
-  **Lightweight & beginner-friendly**

---

##  Requirements

1. **Python 3.x**  â†’ [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. **Scapy** (for packet capturing)
3. **Npcap** (to capture network packets on Windows)

---

##  Installation Guide

### âœ… **1. Install Python & PIP**
- Download & install **Python 3.x** from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Ensure **pip** is added to your system PATH during installation.

### âœ… **2. Install Dependencies**
Open **Command Prompt** and run:

```bash
pip install scapy
```

### âœ… **3. Install Npcap (Windows Only)**
- Download **Npcap** â†’ [Npcap Download](https://nmap.org/npcap/)
- **Run as Administrator** and during installation:
  - âœ… *Check* â†’ "Install Npcap in WinPcap API-compatible Mode"

###  **Why Npcap?**
Npcap is essential for Scapy to access network interfaces and sniff packets on Windows. Without it, the sniffer wonâ€™t run.

##  Running PacketProbe

1. **Run Command Prompt as Administrator** (Windows)
2. Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd path\to\PacketProbe
